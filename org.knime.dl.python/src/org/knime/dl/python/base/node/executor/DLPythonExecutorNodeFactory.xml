	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node allows custom execution of a (Python compatible)
			deep learning network in a local Python installation via a user-defined script.
			The path to the Python executable has to be configured
			in Preferences
			→ KNIME → Python.
		</intro>
		<tab name="Script">
			<option name="Editor">
				The script in the editor panel in the center will be executed to
				generate this node's output.
				"Execute script" will execute the full
				script while "Execute
				selected lines"
				will only execute the currently
				selected part of the
				script.
				<br />
				<br />
				The editor optionally provides autocompletion (CTRL + Space) if the
				Python module
				<b>jedi</b>
				is installed.
			</option>
			<option name="Flow variables">
				The pane on the left side of the editor panel
				lists the available flow variables. A
				double click on a flow variable
				will insert the corresponding identifier at the current
				cursor
				position in the editor panel.
			</option>
			<option name="Workspace">
				The pane on the right side of the editor panel
				is the workspace and lists the currently defined identifiers in the
				running Python instance. "Reset workspace" will remove the output of
				all past script executions.
			</option>
			<option name="Console">
				The console under the editor panel displays standard output, standard
				error, or other information.
			</option>
		</tab>
		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Row limit (dialog)">
				Limits the number of rows of the input table loaded in the dialog.
			</option>
			<option name="Missing values (Int, Long)">
				By default, Int and Long columns containing
				missing values are
				converted to doubles in Python, because doubles
				are the
				only numeric type
				containing a built-in missing value
				representation (NaN). Converting longs to doubles, however,
				introduces imprecision. The
				conversion may be
				avoided by replacing
				missing values with so-called sentinel values. To convert missing
				values to
				sentinel values before script execution, check the first
				option, to convert sentinel values back to missing values after
				script execution, check the second option. To select a sentinel
				value, click on
				MIN_VAL (the smallest possible value for the
				column's
				data type),
				MAX_VAL (the largest possible
				value for the column's data
				type), or a manually enter an integer in the text field.
			</option>
			<option name="Rows per chunk">
				Large tables are broken into chunks when they are transferred between
				Python and Java. This option controls how many rows are included in
				each chunk. The default value is intended for tables containing few
				columns having numeric types. If larger data types like images or text
				are transferred, a single chunk may exceed the
				maximum allowed buffer size. In this case lowering the value of this
				parameter helps getting reasonably sized chunks.
